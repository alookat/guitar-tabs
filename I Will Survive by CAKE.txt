Am                              Dm                         G
At first I was afraid, I was petrified I kept thinkin' I could never live
             C                       F                               Bm
without you by my side But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you’ve
                           Em             E
done me wrong And I grew strong, I learned how to get along...

               Am              Dm                   G
And so you're back from outer space, I just walked in to find you here with
            C                                       F
that, that look upon your face,  I should have changed my freak en lock, I
            Bm                                    Em
would have made you leave your key- If I’d have known for just one second you'd
     E
be back to bother me.


       Am                Dm                  G                     C
Oh now go, walk out the door, Just turn around now, you're not welcome
        F                                    Bm
anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire? Did you think
      Em                        E
I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

       Am          Dm                G                             C
Oh not I, I will survive, Yeah, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be
                 F                            Bm
alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give, I will
   Em              E
survive, I will survive, Yeah, yeah...


(SOLO)


         Am                                       Dm                G
It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart,  I’m tryin' hard to
                        C                        F
mend the pieces of my broken heart, And I spent oh so many nights just
           Bm                        Em             E
feelin' sorry for myself, I used to cry, But now I hold my head up high.


               Am                Dm                 G
And you’ll see me with somebody new, I'm not that stupid little person still
     C                        F                                    Bm
in love with you. And so you thought you’d just drop by and you expect me to
                      Em                          E
be free, But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me,



       Am                Dm                  G                     C
Oh now go, walk out the door, Just turn around now, you're not welcome
        F                                    Bm
anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire? Did you think
      Em                        E
I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

       Am          Dm                G                             C
Oh not I, I will survive, Yeah, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be
                 F                            Bm
alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give, I will
   Em             E
survive, I will survive, Yeah, yeah...
