Verse 1

                        G
Don't forget about the stars the sky
D             C                   G                Gmaj7
Lucid as the air that blows and  light that shines
 D                        C             G
Just a way to figure out her when the night is long
D                     C                   G        Gmaj7                          
Take a little wander outside through the rain and snow
D                         C
Just a way to figure out her
Pre chorus
C
Don't delete my baby don't defeat her still
                 G
In the quite of nothing to the hands of grace

Don't delete my baby don't defeat her now
                C
Don't delete my baby

Won't you always find going to shine  a diamond like you never did
                   G
Going to show you something I can't be taught
                                    C
Don't delete my baby oh fine chorus now

Chorus
                 C
You know that I belong to be reflections of myself
        G                   C                         G
Let it all out just let it all out to find the feeling

Verse 2

Don't take it to the one in mind
D              C           G         Gmaj7
Always know it needed to belong to find
D                 C           G
Know that when I do want to face the place
D                     C                   G       Gmaj7     
Take a little wander outside through the rain and snow 
D                        C
Just a way to figure out her

Don't defeat my baby don't delete her still
                 G
In the quite of nothing to the hands of grace

Don't delete my baby don't defeat her now
                 C
Don't defeat my baby

Won't you always find going to shine a diamond like you never did
                   G
Going to show you something I can't be taught
                                         C                               
Don't delete my baby oh fine the chorus now

Chorus
                 
You know that I belong to be reflections of myself
        G                   C                   G
Let it all out just let it all out to find the feeling

Don't wait 
             G         C      G
Just let it all out
