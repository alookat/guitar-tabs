Intro 4x: Bm7 G D A 


 Bm7            G
See, I feel so lost without you
    D           A
Without you near to me
  Bm7          G
See, I feel so cold without you
    D           A
Without you here to see
  Bm7            G
This world keeps spinning 'round, it's
    D           A
It's orbit here in space
  Bm7           G
And each time I look around, I
    D           A
I swear I see your face
  Bm7            G  D  A
I see your face...
  Bm7           G            D  A
I swear I see your face, there

  Bm7         G
And I know at times I've tested
   D           A
Your patience, hurt your soul
  Bm7     G
But never have I suggested
   D           A
We ever let this go
  Bm7          G
Now I miss you more than you could
   D           A
Could ever realise
  Bm7          G
And if I could take it back, I
   D           A
I promise you I'd try

I'd...


     G
Tell you we could make it matter
     A
Tell you we could make it good
     G
I've got a heart that's made to shatter
     A
Maybe that's the way it should
     G
And I know this world gets crazy
     A
Well I lost all self-control
     G
Where are you to come to save me?
     A
When I need you near to hold?
      
Bm7 G D A
     (A)
[I need you here to hold]


     G
Tell you we could make it matter
     A
Tell you we could make it good
     G
I've got a heart that's made to shatter
     A
Maybe that's the way it should
     G
And I know this world gets crazy
     A
Well I lost all self-control
     G
Where are you to come to save me?
     A
When I need you near to hold?


( Bm7  G  D  A )
   (D)
Oh, my mind is an echo chamber...
Oh, my mind is an echo chamber...
Oh, my mind is an echo chamber... (high tail-off)
Oh, my mind is an echo echo echo echo...

4x: Bm7 G D A 
(Last one slow down on the A and strum a Bm7 to finish)
