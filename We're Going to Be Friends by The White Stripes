INTRO

    G (with picking tab shown below)

VERSE

    G 
    Fall is here, hear the yell
    G 
    Back to school, ring the bell
    C 
    Brand new shoes, walking blues
    G 
    Climb the fence, books and pens

CHORUS

        D               C9              G 
        I can tell that we are gonna be friends
        D               C9              G 
        I can tell that we are gonna be friends

    Walk with me, Suzy Lee
    Through the park and by the tree
    We will rest upon the ground
    And look at all the bugs we found

        Safely walk to school without a sound
        Safely walk to school without a sound

    Here we are, no one else
    We walked to school all by ourselves
    There's dirt on our uniforms
    From chasing all the ants and worms

        We clean up and now it's time to learn
        We clean up and now it's time to learn

    Numbers letters, learn to spell
    Nouns and books and show-and-tell
    Playtime we will throw the ball
    Back to class, through the hall

        Teacher marks our height against the wall
        Teacher marks our height against the wall

BRIDGE

            C                   G 
            We don't notice any time pass
            C                  G 
            We don't notice anything
            A 
            We sit side by side in every class
            C 
            Teacher thinks that I sound funny
            D 
            But she likes the way you sing

    Tonight I'll dream, while I'm in bed
    When silly thoughts go through my head
    About the bugs and alphabet
    And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet

        That you and I will walk together again
        I can tell that we are gonna be friends
        Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends
                                        (end on G6 and let ring)
