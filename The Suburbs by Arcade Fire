[Intro]

C Am E G


[Verse]

C                Am  E              G
 In the suburbs, I     I learned to drive
         C                     Am   E                   G
 And you told me we’d never survive, grab your mother’s keys, we’re leaving

C Am E G

C                     Am   E          G
 You always seemed so sure,  That one day we’d be fighting
C             Am   E              G
 In a suburban war,  your part of town against mine
           C                        Am                E       G
 I saw you standing on the opposite shore, but by the time the first bombs fell
 C               Am    E                  G
 We were already bored,  We were already, already bored


[Chorus]

C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D                C     Am E G
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling again

     C                Am    E           G
 The kids wanna be so hard,   but in my dreams we’re still screaming
     C                   Am    E                G
 And running through the yard,  When all of the walls that they built in the 
 C                 Am   E                G
 Seventies finally fall,  And all of the houses they built in the
 C                 Am                     E                     G
 Seventies finally fall, meant nothing at all, meant nothing at all, it meant nothing


[Chorus]

C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D                     C               Am E G
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling and into the night

C Am E G

C                      Am E              G                        C     Am
 So can you understand,     Why I want a daughter while I’m still young
           E                  G
 I want to hold her hand, and show her some beauty
   C                       Am   E             G
 Before all this damage is done,  but if it’s too much to ask
         C                Am                E    G
 If it’s too much to ask,    Then Send me a son

C                  Am E                G
 Under the overpass     In the parking lot we’re still waiting
      C              Am E              G
 It’s already passed      so move your feet from hot pavement
     C              Am                    E                   G
 And into the grass    cause it’s already past, it’s already, already past


[Chorus]

C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D                C     Am
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling again

E           D                C     Am
 I’m moving past the feeling again
E           D                C     Am
 I’m moving past the feeling again

       G                  C         Am E
 In my dreams we’re still screaming
G                      C Am E 
 We’re still screaming
G                      C Am E 
 We’re still screaming
