VERSE:
Em     Bm       C      D
She is something to behold
Bm  C        Em               Bm  C      D        Bm  C
Elegant and bold
Em     Bm    C    D
She is electricity
Bm      C           Em        Bm  C      D        Bm  C
Running through my soul

C     D

CHORUS:
    Em              D
And I could easily lose my mind
    G                    C
The way you kiss me will work each time
Em                 D
Calling me to come back to bed
        G               C
Singing Georgia on my mind
    Em    D     G     C             
And I...
    Em    D     G     C             
And I...


VERSE:
Em   Bm   C        D
Lips generous and warm
    Bm       C        Em           Bm  C     D        Bm  C
You build me up like steps
Em   Bm    C       D
Eyes innocent and wild
  Bm       C         Em            Bm  C      D        Bm  C
Remind me what it's like

C    D

CHORUS:
    Em              D
And I could easily lose my mind
    G                     C
The way you kiss me will work each time
Em                D
Pulling me back into the flames 
        G                     C
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up 

    Em    D
And I, I never understood what was 
G            C
At stake, I never thought your love was worth
Em                D
It's wait, well now you've come and gone
          G                C
I finally worked it out, I worked it out


BRIDGE: [x2] (100-110 BPM)

Em				   (G)
Don't want it troubling your mind
G		   (C)
Won't you let it be

Don't want it troubling your mind

Won't you let it be

At stake, I never thought your love was worth
